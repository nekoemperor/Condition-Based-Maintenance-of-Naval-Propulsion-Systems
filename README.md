There are two .ipynb datas for solving this regression task, where there are 4 labels (Y) which should be determined.

1. With Decision Tree Regression, training score = 100%

Test score (actual & predicted):
- Y1: R2-Score: 99.92840 %  ; RMSE: 0.08628 %
- Y3: R2-Score: 99.76592 %  ; RMSE: 0.31195 %
- Y4: R2-Score: 99.60952 %  ; RMSE: 0.10072 %
- Y5: R2-Score: 99.52453 %  ; RMSE: 0.05560 %

2. With Neural Networks

Test score (actual & predicted):
- Y1: RMSE: 0.0027 or 0.27%
- Y3: RMSE: TBA
- Y4: RMSE: TBA
- Y5: RMSE: TBA
